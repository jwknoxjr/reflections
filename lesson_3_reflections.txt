When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If you want to access the repository from more than one computer, or by more than one person, a remote repository makes this very easy to do.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If others are working on the repository, you probably don't want their additions until you're done implementing
your changes.  Also, you probably don't want to pull changes until you're done building the change.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branch is for any new design feature which will be separate from the master (separate so that master
is always the official branch).  Once done, the branch can be merged back into the master.  A clone is
a new copy of a repository, either on your workstation or on GitHub.  A fork is only on GitHub, and
technically is a clone.
