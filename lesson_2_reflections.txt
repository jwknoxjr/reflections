What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?  
Create the .git directory and supporting files for git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?  The staging area is a middle ground where files from
the working directory get checked in before being committed to a repository.  
This is a convenient way to build up the commit one piece at a time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?  Use git status to check over the staging area and see each file which
has changed.  You can mentally check while looking over the changes that all
changes are for the same logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?  We've just seen some examples: an easy-mode
branch, an Italian language branch, a branch for an experimental feature.  It
seems that any time you're diverging in a fairly large fashion (which might end
up being thrown away), a branch is a very good idea.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?  Mostly, it just
makes each branch and all its commits easier to see.  One big thing is that it
will show you if you have any unreachable commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?  The result is the sum of all changes between the
two branches.  It's represented as two into one convergence because that's 
just what it is.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?  Automatic merging is much quicker than manual, and requires much
less effort.  It can't figure out every merge, though, so sometimes you 
need to do the manual fixing.
